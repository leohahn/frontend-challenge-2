# Frontend Challenge 2

Your goal here is to implement the following design:

Here's a description of how the app should work:

You should list all existing benefits and list them in the main screen. Whenever you click on the buttons "criar" or "filtrar", a side panel will open. Depending on the button you clicked, you'll be able to either create a new benefit or filter the existing list in the screen.

In the create side panel, you should prompt the user for a name and a type. A name is a text input field and the type a dropdown list with an autocomplete functionality. This view will allow the user to create a new benefit.

In the filter panel, you can filter the existing benefits in two ways:
- The name of the benefit.
- The type of the benefit. This one is a multi-select.

**Requirements**
- You should write the code in the same way you would write code professionally.
- You should match your result against the design.

**Process**
- Create a new repository in GitHub setup a frontend project in any way you like. You can use any language/framework/library to solve this. The only thing you can't use is ready-made component frameworks that already give you the implemented component.
- Copy the existing code from this repository to your new repository.
- In a branch separate from main, implement the design and functionality. We expect the exercise to take around ~3-4 hours to complete.
- Create a pull request against main once it's ready, consider the same process as you normally do for sending a pull request.
- Invite @leohahn to your repository.
- Send an e-mail/linkedin message/wpp message with the PR link.
- After that we'll schedule a call so that we can go over everything you've done and the pull request as well.
